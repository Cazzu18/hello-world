# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow for my CSC 430 class.

My name is Edmund Howell III Longsworth and I am a senior at Murray State University studying Computer Science. I completed my associate degree in computer science as the valedictorian from 2021 to 2023. Then, I completed a year toward my Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, Canada. Following that, I decided to transfer to Murray State University where I will complete my Bachelor's in Computer Science. My goal here is not merely to pass, but to learn as much as possible before my time elapses.
